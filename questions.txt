N is given generate and print pattern, based on n.

i) for each row starting from first print numbers in decending orders from n to 1
ii) each nbumber in a row is repeated aas many times as the current row index.
iii) insted of printing each row on a new line, seperate the rows with -1
iv) insted of a new line at the end of each row, print -1 to indicate row seperation

after printing ther entitre pattern, end the output with -1
